        <h1>About Me<h1>
            <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>I am a junior in high school with interests in mathematics, physics, and environmental justice. Outside of school, I enjoy 
                    crocheting, listening to music, and reading.
                </p>
            <h3>Game Definition</h3>
                <p>I defined a game as something played for enjoyment and that allows the user to progress or advance in skill, strategy, or through 
                    the levels of the game.
                </p>
