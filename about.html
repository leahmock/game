            <h3>Game Definition</h3>
                <p>I defined a game as something played for enjoyment and that allows the user to progress or advance in skill, strategy, or through 
                    the levels of the game.
                </p>

            <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
                <p>My favorite game is sudoku, which I enjoy because I find it satisfying to complete puzzles and progress through challenges. I also 
                    enjoy similar games like kenken and blockduko.
