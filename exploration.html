                <p>
                    For our board game, we chose to create an animal-themed board game. We selected four pieces (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit, and a cat) 
                    for the player to select, and created different themed tiles that would either help or harm the player. We then developed the rules 
                    of the game, and we modified them as we played a test round. Initially, we made the game too difficult for it to be enjyable, as 
                    players had to roll certain numbers to even enter the game. This resulted in too much downtime for unlucky players who did not roll
                    that number. We then added more bonus tiles to the game, which made it too easy for lucky players. From this experience, we learned
                    how to balance the level of difficulty of our game while still making it enjoyable to play. We also learned that the first set of 
                    instructions we wrote were too complicated, which made it difficult for people to immediately understand them and successfully 
                    play the game.

                <p>
                    To create the click game, I first draw two icons in Piskel, one of the character in a "normaal" state and one for the character 
                    when it had been clicked. Then, Ifollowed the tutorial to create the click game using python in Mu. After I followed the tutorial,
                    I made a few modifications to the code, such as adding code that changed the speed of the character when it was clicked. I used the
                    random functionality of python to do this. Before creating the click game, I had not previously used python to create anything, 
                    so I first learned the basics of python while doing this assignment.
